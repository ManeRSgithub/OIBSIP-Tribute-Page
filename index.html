                <li>1.  One of his four sisters Mitu Singh was a state-level cricket player.Sushant sir attended the St. Karen's High School in Patna.His family moved to Delhi following his mother's death in 2002 where Rajput completed his schooling for intermediate studies in Kulachi Hansraj Model School.</li>
                <li>2. Sushant sir was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in astrophysics and won the National Olympiad in Physics.He secured admission in the Delhi College of Engineering (later renamed Delhi Technological University) to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering</li>
                <li>3. According to Sushant sir, he did not have any interest in engineering but his family gave him no option which left him dissatisfied. He instead wanted to become an astronaut and later an air force pilot but was also interested in Bollywood.</li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>Sushant Singh Rajput, the eternal good-boy of Bollywood, is one of the few television actors who have successfully made a crossover to Bollywood and this is a big feat considering the number of actors who have not really tasted success in Indian cinema.

                    The first thing you notice when you visit his profile is that the man is giving some massive fitness goals to his fans. But beyond that, if you dig deeper, you’d realize how much Sushant loves his fans.
                    
                    He is one of the few stars who is humble and down to earth and follows a number of fan pages. This is also owing to the fact that it is the fans who are the deal-makers and breakers when it comes to superstardom (essentially for those who do not belong to Bollywood families).</li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li> A career in films is always as uncertain as anything else can be. And while Rajput indeed had some unsuccessful films like Raabta, Sonchiriya and Drive, overall, he probably had an enviable graph to look at. Two mega commercially successful films like M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story and Chhichhore, a fairly successful film in Kedarnath, critical acclaim with Detective Byomkesh Bakshy and Sonchiriya, his filmography is actually rather impressive</li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>  Sushant sir's personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media attention. In 2011, Rajput publicly proposed to his Pavitra Rishta co-star Ankita Lokhande during a national broadcast of the dance competition show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa;both of them had participated in the show as competing contestants.The couple began dating after their first meeting on the set of Pavitra Rishta, where they had been cast as husband and wife to each other.In 2012, they began living together and reports of an imminent marriage between the two occasionally cropped up in the media.In an interview, sir stated that marriage and cohabitation were no different and that it was hypocritical to treat the former as sacred and the latter as a crime.At an event, he had said, "I am very transparent about my relationships. I mean I will not hesitate to say that I am in a relationship".</li>
                <li> In 2014, rumours that they were already secretly married due to family pressure were denied by the couple. In January 2016, Rajput confirmed that a lavish wedding would take place in December, but the relationship ended prior to that, with the pair maintaining silence on the reasons for the cancellation.In a 2021 interview, Lokhande said that Rajput wanted to go ahead in his career and they ended their relationship mutually</li>
                <li> After the breakup, sir's relationship status became the subject of speculation and gossip.He was rumored to be dating his Raabta co-star Kriti Sanon which was denied by both of them.In 2017, sir courted controversy when he came out in support of the producers of Padmaavat whose sets were vandalised by members of the Rajput Karni Sena.That same year, he became the co-owner of Delhi Gladiators, a team in the Super Boxing League. <Strong> In preparation for his role in Chanda Mama Door Ke, he was given the opportunity to train at NASA where he intended to go back and complete his instructor training, aspiring to be chosen for the 2024 Artemis program. Retaining his interest in astronomy and astrophysics, he purchased the high end Meade LX-600 16" telescope for stargazing purposesHe also had a collection of 125 books including a six-volume theoretical physics series. Sir stated in an August 2017 interview that his collection was not for film research, but covered personal interests in multiple disciplines, including cognitive science and behavioral economics.He was reportedly an avid reader who would bring books during tours for film shooting.
                    </Strong>
                </li>
                <li> In 2018, he was the subject of another rumour regarding his Kedarnath co-star Sara Ali Khan.The rumours were never confirmed as before the two supposedly broke up, sir refused to comment on the claims.Later in the next year, it was reported that he was dating actress Rhea Chakraborty and that they intended to keep the matter private. When questioned, he reportedly unwittingly confirmed the relationship by stating that if interviewers asked questions that were only about him, he could answer at his own discretion but he would also have to ask "somebody" before confirming any details.Chakraborty and Rajput were occasionally spotted on "dates" and outings in Mumbai,and on a vacation to the Himalayan region of Ladakh.</li>
                
                <li> After Sir's death, Chakraborty confirmed that she was his girlfriend and that he would refuse medication, relying instead on yoga and meditation. According to Rajput's father, the actor mentioned his plans to marry in 2021 but did not reveal his intended bride; Ankita Lokhande was the only girlfriend that his father had known about.</li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>  Three years after actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death, the high profile case appears to be resurfacing, with new claims emerging about it being a possible murder
                </li>
                <li>
                    According to a report by ANI, the mortuary servant at the Cooper Hospital in Mumbai where the actor's body had been sent for post-mortem has claimed that the 34-year-old's death did not appear to be a suicide. "When I saw Sushant Singh Rajput's body, it didn't appear to be the case of suicide. There were injury marks on his body",Roopkumar Shah, mortuary servant, told the Agency.
                </li>
                <li> Shah who has over 28 years of experience, went on to say that there were no marks on Sushant sir's body that are generally found in hanging cases</li>
                <li>"There were fracture marks on his body," Shah told ANI, adding that he had approached his senior for the same, but had been told that it would be discussed later.

                </li>
                <li>"What to write in the post-mortem report is the doctor's job," Shah further said, adding, "He [Sushant] should get justice."
                </li>
                <li>"Everyone can tell by looking at the picture of Sushant Singh Rajput that he was murdered," he further said.
                </li>
                <li>"If the investigating agency calls me, I will also tell them [the same]," he asserted.
                </li>
                <li>The 34-year-old actor was found dead in his Mumbai residence on June 14, 2020, following which the post-mortem report stated that the cause of death was asphyxia.
